# Marshmallow Sofa
A fun game to play with friends no matter the distance. Inspired by a campfire game called “What Would You Do If…?”, our game Marshmallow Sofa leads to lots of laughs in person and on discord calls!

# Motivation
Our inspiration was a game that one of our team members has played around the campfire since childhood. It is a camping tradition for larger groups of friends and family. We were also inspired by the properties of games by JackBox and the game Gartic Phone for how our game would function on multiple devices at the same time.

# Build Status 
Right now, we have created a solid structure for the game, though we wish to add cosmetic and convenient features to make the gameplay a more enjoyable experience. These features include:
- Music mute button
- exit game button
- number of rounds prompter
- light mode (daytime campsite)
- a waiting page
- player submission status (shows which players have submitted their answers already
- etc.
  
We have a lot of plans for this web app to hopefully make it great so that people everywhere can play.

# Code Style
This project is coded in standard vanilla JavaScript.

# Framework Used
Hosted in Google Firebase, this game was built using Angular for front end, ExpressJS for the backend server, and utilizing the socket.io package for our web sockets. Graphics, icons, and art were done in Apple Procreate.

# Features
This web game has a calming atmosphere, relaxing lo-fi beats, and original artwork. Angular UI/UX has allowed for the creation of a clean user interface on both the player and host computer.

# How To Use
This game is very simple to play. 
The host will visit the link marshmallowsofa-af.web.app, and select create new game. Then, they can copy a link to send to friends in order to join a game lobby! The first user to join this lobby will be consideed the host, and will have the power to start the game once all of the playes have joined. Once the game is started, the instructions are given on the host tv screen to be followd.

# Credits
Credit is to be given to the family members who came up with this campfire game many years ago, so that it may be turned into a web app by us.

- Additionally, we are partnering with MLH this year, which means that our hackers must follow their code of conduct which can be found below.
- Any and all resources used must be open source and specified in either the project, or the project description.
- Your project must be publically available and under source control in this repository.
- Prior to submitting to devpost, your project must be fully committed and pushed to this repository.
